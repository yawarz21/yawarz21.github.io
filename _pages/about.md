Hi there! I am a PhD student in the Department of Electrical Engineering at [Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in/), where my advisor is [Prof. Yogesh Singh Chauhan](https://home.iitk.ac.in/~chauhan/). I am associated with [Nanolab](https://www.iitk.ac.in/nanolab/) and I am part of the [BSIM-BULK](https://bsim.berkeley.edu/models/bsimbulk/) group there.

My current research focuses on modeling of Electronic Devices in general.

Feel free to get in touch with me!
